1. React components : Resuable UI elements for your app. First letter of React component names must be capitalized.

2. React Props : React components use props to communicate with each other. Every parent component can pass some information to its child components by giving them props. 

3. Fragements : <Fragment>, often used via <>...</> syntax, lets you group elements without a wrapper node.

4.  Objects are not valid as a React child

5. Although a variable declared with const cannot be reassigned to a different value, the contents of the object it references can still be modified.

6. React hooks are functions that let React function components store state, run side effects, and remember values across renders.

6. Event handlers are your own functions that will be triggered in response to interactions like clicking, hovering, focusing form inputs, and so on.

7. Lifting state up means moving state from a child component to the closest common parent so multiple components can share it. lifting state up directly improves modularity by separating shared data and logic from reusable UI components.
